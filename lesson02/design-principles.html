            <div>

            <p>Fitts’s law is a predictive model for the speed of human movement, commonly used in human-computer interaction.
                 It states that the time it takes someone to select an object depends on how far they are from the object and 
                 the size of the object. Small objects that are far from your starting position or related objects that are far 
                 away from each other take the longest time to select. Large objects that are close to your starting position or 
                 related objects that are close together take the shortest time to select.
                 (see <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fitts-law">blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fitts-law</a>) <br>
                The website for Raising Cane's chicken finger restaurant illustrates this point by the location of the menu button
                as well as the button for ordering. The typical way a person handles their phone is with 2 hands gripping the device
                by the fingers as the thumbs are hovering over the screen. The location of the buttons makes the travel time of the
                thumbs very short. The buttons are also reasonable sized to proivide an obvious target for clicking. This design
                choice makes it easier and more likely for people to order from thier website.

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <h4>Amazon</h4>
            <div class="link"><a href="www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a></div>
            <div>
                <img src="images/amazon.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. 
                Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. 
                By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users’ perceptions and guide them to desired actions.
                (see <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy#:~:text=Visual%20hierarchy%20is%20the%20principle,users%20can%20understand%20information%20easily.">interaction-design.org</a>)
                <br>The website for Amazon is a good example of visual hierarchy. The search bar and menu are placed at the top of <thead>
                page for users to notice first. These tools are typically what the users are looking to use to find the item they came for.
                Below the top of the window, are the advertisments for sales and collections of items that might interest the user.
                These advertisments are larger and more visually interesting to draw the user to cliking those ads.

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <h4>Google</h4>
            <div class="link"><a href="google.com">Google.com</a></div>            
            <div>
                <img src="images/google.png" width="296px" height="640px">
            </div>
            <p>Hick's Law states that the time it takes to make a decision 
                increases with the number and complexity of choices presented. (see <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/">LawsofUX.com</a>)<br>
                The main web page for Google is a prime example of Hick's law. The page is very simplistic and offers very few choices.
                The visual hierarchy draws the user to the first of very few choices, the search bar. Google.com wastes no time with
                other visual choices. Most users come to the website with the intent to use the search bar and the design of the page
                helps speed the user to their destination.
